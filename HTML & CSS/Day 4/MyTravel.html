      Tourism is the largest and fastest-growing industry across the world. It
      is a source of revenue and employment. It also gives the opportunity for
      people to understand the culture, civilization, and religious aspects of
      a country. There are many countries whose main source of revenue is
      Tourism. It is an export that is not visible which earns valuable
      foreign exchange without any substantial or actual loss of internal
      resources. Tourism is a unique type of highly labor-intensive industry.
      It provides different services that are needed as well as expected by
      the incoming tourists. Tourism is one of the largest industries in terms
      of money spent by tourists in the countries they visit. The amount
      received from the Tourism industries sometimes exceeds the Gross
      National Product of many countries. India is one of the most popular
      tourist destinations in Asia and has been successful in attracting
      domestic and international tourists. India has fascinated many tourists
      across the globe with her secularism and her culture. The scenic
      landscape, hill stations, historical sites, architecture and monuments,
      beaches, and enchanting backwater, places of religious interest make
      India a preferred destination for tourists from all over the world.
      Tourism in India has immense potential of developing into a high
      revenue-generating industry. Better connectivity of transport and
      communication, improved hospitality services and standard of living and
      value of money to the tourists from foreign countries have led to an
      increase in domestic as well as international Tourism.
